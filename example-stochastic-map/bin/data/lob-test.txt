For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages It is true that the most ancient men the first librarians used a language quite different from the one we now speak it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up it is incomprehensible All this I repeat is true but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCVs cannot correspond to any language no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page but this vague thesis did not prevail Others thought of cryptographs generally this conjecture has been accepted though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators
